HAAR:
Use HAAR to detect human gives too many false positives. HAAR is more suitable for face or eye detection.
Also one needs to change scale factor and minimum neighbours in HAAR cascade which is not same for all the image. 

HOG:
Histograms of Oriented Gradients (HOG) algorithm for people detection/counting, native in OpenCV.
Here, "histogram" refers to a distribution (for example, a cluster of similar things, such as edges), 
"oriented" means directions and "gradients" refer to x, y derivatives 
(as in calculus, we’re looking for slopes here). 
Two types of gradients are used as features: edges (which include curves) and intensity. 
Curves and edges are the main idea for this type of problem (detection of objects such as people), 
and for HOG filter approaches in general. 
A HOG filter is a linear classifier, which means that it’s very good at sorting things 
into “buckets” based on multi-dimensional features (such as curves and edges).
